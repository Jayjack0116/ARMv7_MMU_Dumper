Bare Metal ARMv7 MMU Translation Table Dumper

All you need is to define printf() and the code should work with your bare metal project.
This code was hacked together and was designed to be used once or twice and is not readable.

Features:
-Dumps all first and second level entries pointed to by TBBR0/TBBR1
-Dumps permissions, virtual address, and physical addresses
-Supports TBBR1 N bit remapping
-Supports simplified permissions with AFE set
-C89 complient, no std libraries needed

Caveats:
-No support for super-sections
-Must be running in supervisor with all domains accessable
-Does not parse TEX/region attributes
